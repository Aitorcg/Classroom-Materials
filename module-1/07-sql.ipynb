Also, a column may or may not contain `null` values. On mySQL, we must define beforehand these posibilities. And don't forget that the information stored on a column must be relevant and somewhat permanent! In some cases, information such as `age` doesn't make much sense to store it in a column, for it will change constantly. And this data can be easily calculated with a permanent column of `date of birth`.\n",
